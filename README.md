## What is an ERC-20 Token?
The Ethereum blockchain allows you to create your own cryptocurrency, or token, that can be purchased with Ether, the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain. ERC-20 is simply a standard that specifies how these tokens behave, so that they are compatible with other platforms like cryptocurrency exchanges.
